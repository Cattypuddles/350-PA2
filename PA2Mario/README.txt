Instructions:
1. Run Super Mario Bros
2. Program should read "Mario.txt" and run simulation from there. Feel free to edit "Mario.txt" to change spawn rates, lives, and levels.


NOTE-
This project has a bug in which, once defeating the boss, the program exits. The level transition is currently broken, but all has been
coded in. 
The file write to Log.txt also does not work, despite my syntax being correct. Who knows why.
